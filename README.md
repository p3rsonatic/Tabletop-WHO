# Tabletop Work Helper Operator

Tools to ease RPG development from a map editor to sheet writer.

## Why?

- I need to improve my programming skills
- I want to facilitate the development and gameplay of my RPG sessions (which I have not played for years now)
- The luxury of a centralized working environment to make RPGs easily and for free - when I made my campaigns I did not want to waste money paying websites to make world maps, tile maps, play online or to automate combat or sheet filling, so I had to go to many different websites and software that had tools to help me develop my campaign. With a centralized environment with all the tools I need and without the need to pay I could ease my development process.
- I need to bargain my way back to the land of OPZ  

## Intended tools and design

- Dice roller - works both in a vacuum and as an automated tool for combat, test rolls, etc.
- Player sheet writer - not just a way to fill the sheets but also to automate the process of having to look up skills and magic that you can acquire when you level up (from experience, this saves a LOT of time).
- Time tracker - for realistic actions according to the rules of D&D that require you to keep track of game time, a time tracker would be a useful tool to really manage travel time, grimoire setup, resting, etc.
- Map editor - editor to make grid maps a lot easier, with procedural generation for cities, buildings and dungeons, placing objects, NPCs, Players.
- File importer and exporter - a way to be able to setup my adventures easily, exporting sheets, maps and coordinates of NPCs, players and objects.
- Asset Manager - a way to implement custom resources like audio, tiles and player models.
- Modular design - if I find a way to manage a modular design so it works for RPGs in general, not only D&D, I think it would be a bonus, also I would not have to maintain all of the code base in case something changes or I want to add or remove something.

## Idealistic ambitions

- Playable multiplayer - if the Master has control of everything and can share a certain scene to players each in their own and screen, vision (each one sees a certain limit of blocks depending on their vision distance and night vision) and UI with hit points, weight, level, inventory it would be a pretty solid tool not only for development but also for built-in gameplay.
- Manual control first, automation second - in a tabletop RPG improvisation is the strongest skill you can have, not all things have to go according to the rule book, so let's say I want to create a combat scene that is not simply each one takes turns to hit an opponent and blah blah blah, I want to suddenly kill an NPC or interfere in the situation, manual control needs to come first and then automated combat calculations and functioning as an option.
- Multiple scenes at the same time - This could really change gameplay. If I want to separate the players and put them in different places, I could manage new ways of storytelling instead of everyone having to stay in the same place or staying in different places without anything to visualize but my narrative.
- Procedural textures and meshes - just to reduce memory storage, run certain models at startup then use them in the editor.
- Mobile support - It would be cool if I could play with friends that do not have access to a computer easily.
